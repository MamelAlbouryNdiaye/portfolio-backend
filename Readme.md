## About The Project

This is my full-stack developer portfolio built with the MERN stack.  
It dynamically fetches projects and skills from a MongoDB database via a deployed Express API.

The goal of this project was to:

- Build a production-ready full-stack application
- Deploy a backend on Render
- Deploy a frontend on Vercel
- Connect MongoDB Atlas in production
- Manage environment variables properly
- Handle real-world deployment issues (CORS, env, connection errors)
